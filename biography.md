## Python Library
- **Korean News Scraper** - 2024.03 - [Project Link](https://github.com/kar7mp5/korean-news-scraper)
  
  Developed and deployed a Python library for collecting data to train Large Language Models (LLM).
  This was my first Python library, and while there were many areas to improve, it was a great experience learning about Python deployment and automation.

- **Notion News Crawler** - 2024.07 - [Project Link](https://github.com/kar7mp5/notion-news-crawler), [Blog](https://kar7mp5.tistory.com/)
  
  Developed a crawler for collecting news by category from Notion.
  During development, access to Notion's database was challenging, leading to the creation of a Python library for better integration.
  I set up a server running on a Raspberry Pi that works every 4 hours to upload relevant news to Notion.

## AI
- **Reinforcement Learning: Drone Project** - 2024.01 ~ 2024.02 - [Project Link](https://github.com/kar7mp5/drone-rl)
  
  Developed a simulation for drone control using reinforcement learning. Focused on both the physical engine and reinforcement learning algorithms.

- **Large Language Model (LLM) Project** - 2024.03 ~ 2024.06 - [Project Link](https://github.com/kar7mp5/llm-transformer)
