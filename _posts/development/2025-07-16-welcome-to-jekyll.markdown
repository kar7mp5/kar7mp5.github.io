# Welcome to My Dev Blog!

Hello! This blog is a space to record my development studies, project experiences, and various technical thoughts.

## Main Blog Topics
- Jekyll, GitHub Pages, blog automation
- Python, JavaScript, Web development
- Dev teams, problem solving, code review

## Recent Thoughts

> "How can I grow more efficiently?"

- I believe in the power of consistent journaling and feedback.
- I am also challenging myself with open source and community activities.

## Code Example

```python
# Example Python code often posted on the blog
def hello(name):
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
hello("Jekyll")
```

## Math Example

Inline math: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$

Block math:
$$
\nabla \cdot \vec{E} = \frac{\rho}{\varepsilon_0}
$$

## Future Goals
- Write regularly
- Communicate with various developers
- Grow technically

Thank you! ðŸš€
